This repository is for "Temperature-dependence of life history in an edible cricket: Implications for optimising mass rearing" by Jacinta D. Kong, Ã‰mile Vadboncoeur, Susan M. Bertram, and Heath A. MacMillan.

The study comprises of two independent experiments: Part 1 and Part 2.
Data were analysed in R.
Each part has an associated supplementary code (html):

* Supplementary Code Part 1: life history from hatch to death
* Supplementary Code Part 2: reproduction

# Data
This folder contains the raw data and code for both experiments. The metadata are described in the respective supplementary code.

## Part 1
This experiment aimed to characterise the effects of rearing temperature on the life history of *Gryllodes sigillatus*, the banded cricket.

Two datasets (csv) are associated with part 1:

1. TPC_mass - Weekly observations of mass, sex and instar
2. TPC_survival - Survival and maturation data

## Part 2
This experiment aimed to characterise the effects of rearing temperature on the reproductive output of *Gryllodes sigillatus*, the banded cricket under common garden conditions. This experiment follows up from Part 1 and uses a subset of temperature treatments from Part 1.

Three datasets (csv) are associated with part 2:

1. F1_ParentID - Life history information about the parents
2. F1_eggs - Number of eggs laid for each pair every 48h
3. F1_hatch - Batches of eggs incubated

# Supplementary incubator data
This folder contains the raw temperature and humidity data for the incubators used in this study.
